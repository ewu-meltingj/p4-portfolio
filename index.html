					<h2>
						Sitting in a Hamburger
					</h2>
					<p>
						All of the individual sites you know and love—New York, Drinks, Slice, A Hamburger Today, Chicago, and Sweets—are rolling back into Serious Eats itself. We'll still cover those topics in the same spirited way, but everything is going to live on what we like to call the United States of Serious Eats, making it easier than ever to get at all the original content you love.

					<h2>
						Eating all of that Jazz
					</h2>
					<p>
						Lee's Hamburgers expanded in the early 1950s, when Hash's business partner and meat supplier Leon Saizan Sr. opened and operated a second location. In 1965, damage from Hurricane Betsy forced the original location to move farther away from the fading glamour of the Hollywood set, but Lee's remained an institution. Hash chopped the onions and worked the grill until his death in 1970. Saizan was given sole rights to the business, and soon after he retired from the meat business.

					<h2>
						The Cheese is Old and Moldy
					</h2>
					<p>
						Since then, several locations have come and gone, and the ones that remain aren't all created equal. Fueled by warm memories of visiting Lee's as a kid, I tried the location on Metairie Road in Old Metairie and left disappointed. Luckily, a location on Veterans Memorial Boulevard in Metairie lived up to my memories.

					<p>
						The Original ($4.69) with grilled onions, mayo, mustard, ketchup, and pickle is a departure from Hash's philosophy of mustard and onions only. The onions stand out at first glance, and the bun is warm, moist, and well proportioned. Per my request, the staff happily tried to cook the loosely packed ground chuck to medium instead of the usual well-done, but the difference was negligible.
