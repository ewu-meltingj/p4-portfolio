						Sitting in a Hamburger

						All of the individual sites you know and love—New York, Drinks, Slice, A Hamburger Today, Chicago, and Sweets—are rolling back into Serious Eats itself. We'll still cover those topics in the same spirited way, but everything is going to live on what we like to call the United States of Serious Eats, making it easier than ever to get at all the original content you love.

						The queen is the most powerful piece. She can move in any one straight direction - forward, backward, sideways, or diagonally - as far as possible as long as she does not move through any of her own pieces. And, like with all pieces, if the queen captures an opponent's piece her move is over. Click through the diagram below to see how the queens move. Notice how the white queen captures the black queen and then the black king is forced to move.

						Lee's Hamburgers expanded in the early 1950s, when Hash's business partner and meat supplier Leon Saizan Sr. opened and operated a second location. In 1965, damage from Hurricane Betsy forced the original location to move farther away from the fading glamour of the Hollywood set, but Lee's remained an institution. Hash chopped the onions and worked the grill until his death in 1970. Saizan was given sole rights to the business, and soon after he retired from the meat business.

						Pawns are unusual because they move and capture in different ways: they move forward, but capture diagonally. Pawns can only move forward one square at a time, except for their very first move where they can move forward two squares. Pawns can only capture one square diagonally in front of them. They can never move or capture backwards. If there is another piece directly in front of a pawn he cannot move past or capture that piece.

						Since then, several locations have come and gone, and the ones that remain aren't all created equal. Fueled by warm memories of visiting Lee's as a kid, I tried the location on Metairie Road in Old Metairie and left disappointed. Luckily, a location on Veterans Memorial Boulevard in Metairie lived up to my memories.

						Pawns have another special ability and that is that if a pawn reaches the other side of the board it can become any other chess piece (called promotion). A pawn may be promoted to any piece. [NOTE: A common misconception is that pawns may only be exchanged for a piece that has been captured. That is NOT true.] A pawn is usually promoted to a queen. Only pawns may be promoted.

						The Original ($4.69) with grilled onions, mayo, mustard, ketchup, and pickle is a departure from Hash's philosophy of mustard and onions only. The onions stand out at first glance, and the bun is warm, moist, and well proportioned. Per my request, the staff happily tried to cook the loosely packed ground chuck to medium instead of the usual well-done, but the difference was negligible.
					</p>
					<p>
						One other special rule is called castling. This move allows you to do two important things all in one move: get your king to safety (hopefully), and get your rook out of the corner and into the game. On a player’s turn he may move his king two squares over to one side and then move the rook from that side’s corner to right next to the king on the opposite side.
					</p>
					<p>
						As stated before, the purpose of the game is to checkmate the opponent’s king. This happens when the king is put into check and cannot get out of check. There are only three ways a king can get out of check: move out of the way (though he cannot castle!), block the check with another piece, or capture the piece threatening the king. If a king cannot escape checkmate then the game is over. Customarily the king is not captured or removed from the board, the game is simply declared over.
